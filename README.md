# 3D-AE
An autoencoder with an architecture designed from the ground up for task-fMRI data to explore the nonlinear latent space representation of data.

-	We present an approach for finding an interpretable latent representation.
-	A semi-supervised autoencoder is applied to two large task fMRI dataset.
-	Normative model is used to map latent variables to non-imaging measures.
-	The autoencoder shows high performance in terms of age and sex prediction.
-	The model captures complex biological, cognitive, and clinical characteristics.
